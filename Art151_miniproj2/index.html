    <h2>Dérive</h2>

    <h4>"One of the basic situationist practices is the dérive,(1) a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiences. 
        Dérives involve playful-constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects, 
        and are thus quite different from the classic notions of journey or stroll."
    </h4>


    <p>
        As I progressed through the Theory of the Derive, I couldn't help but make several connections to what was going 
        through my mind during the reading. As each page progresses, there exists a connection between each stop, 
        a description of the existing connection. 
        This site could be a variation of wikipedia, where a connection from one topic to another already exists.

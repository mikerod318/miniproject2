    <h4>"Chance is a less important factor in this activity than one might think: from a d√©rive point of view cities have psychogeographical contours, 
        with constant currents, 
        fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones."</h4>
    
    
    <p>
        In connection with the previous two stops, there exists a fundamental psychogeographical connection as well as a mathematical view point. 
        After reading the above quote, this was what I was immediately drawn to with a direction connection to the previous stops. 
        From seashells in the previous to galaxies, these ratios or sequences can be found anywhere, as above is below.

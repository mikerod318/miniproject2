        the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities."</h4>

        What stood out the most to me was the domination of variation followed by an infinite calculation. 
        This can be found anywhere, from equations to real life nature examples. 
        There exists an infintie possiblity of this, found anywhere.
